# **Traffic Sign Recognition** 

## Writeup

**Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Project**

The steps of this project are the following:
* Load the data set which is provided in the classroom, which is a resized partial [German Traffic Sign data set](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset)
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
* Pre-process origin data set
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
* Summarize the results with a written report

## Rubric Points
### Here I will consider the [rubric points](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/481/view) individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.

### Writeup

#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one. You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf. You can use this template as a guide for writing the report. The submission includes the project code.

You're reading it! and here is a link to my [project code](https://github.com/JayLSU/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project/blob/master/Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb)
